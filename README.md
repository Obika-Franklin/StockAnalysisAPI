# Deployment of a Stock Volatility Forecasting System using GARCH Model, FastAPI, and Web Interface

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning and API development techniques to create a practical tool for financial analysis and decision-making. In this project, we will utilize a GARCH (Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model for stock volatility prediction, then we will develope a stock volatility prediction API using the model. This API will allow users to:

1. **Train an ML model** for a specific stock ticker, using either the latest data from Alpha Vantage or historical data stored in a SQLite database.
2. **Obtain volatility predictions** for a trained model, specifying the desired prediction horizon (number of days).

**Technical Details:**

*   **Data Acquisition and Storage:** The project utilizes the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve daily stock data and stores it in a SQLite database for efficient management.
*   **Model Training:** The GARCH model is employed to capture the volatility patterns in the stock data.
*   **API Development:** FastAPI is used to create a RESTful API that exposes endpoints for model training and prediction. Pydantic is used for data validation and ensuring the correctness of request parameters.
*   **Model Persistence:** Trained models are saved to disk using joblib, allowing for reuse without retraining.
*   **Deployment with ngrok:** The API is deployed using ngrok, which creates a public URL for accessing the application hosted on your Google Colab instance.
*   **Interactive Documentation:** Swagger UI or ReDoc is automatically generated by FastAPI, providing users with interactive documentation to understand and interact with the API.
*   **Web Application Development:** A web app is developed using **Plotly Dash** to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface that enables real-time use of the prediction system without requiring users to understand the underlying code.

**Benefits and Use Cases:**

*   **Volatility Forecasting:** The API provides a tool for predicting the volatility of a stock, which is valuable information for investors and traders in making informed decisions.
*   **Risk Management:** Volatility predictions can be used to assess the risk associated with a particular stock and to develop risk mitigation strategies.
*   **Automated Trading:** The API can be integrated into automated trading systems to trigger actions based on volatility forecasts.
*   **Research and Analysis:** Researchers and analysts can utilize the API to study stock market volatility and develop trading algorithms.
